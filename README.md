#OGAM 2014 APRIL - THEME: WATER

This is my submission to one game a month jam.

## Game Design

### Brainstorm

### Introduction
In the wastelands, starvation, loneliness, thirst, the wild against your life and all you want is to survive. As the little kid you're trying to stay alive, but for that you must find water and food, and you're all alone against the desert perils. A 2D action puzzle with colorful art and thrilling music.

### Characters biography
Karawã
A beautiful flower in the desert, she is the little nomad girl looking for water. The player will play as her and she will look very fragile at first but must be perceived as a strong girl as the time passes.

### Plot

TBD

### Gameplay

Each level must be completed after collecting water, food or both. In order
to complete them, the player must move through the level with careful considering
the current perils, the only tool she carries is a small shovel.

Player actions

* use shovel
* move (naturally walk)
* run
* drink water

Enemies or Danger

* heat (makes her water bar lower)
* scorpions
* vulture
* sandstorm (just blocks the path)
* wild dogs
* poisonous lizards and lizards

Karawã gets weaker with heat exposure, if she gets dry (empty water bar) she will
faint and die and them is game over.
To avoid dying the player can:

* finish the search for water/food quickly;
* Drink water from water sources (i.e. cactus, rain);
* Hide on shadows (this is suposed to be very rare).

### Technology

* Love2D
* Moonscript
'MoonScript is a dynamic scripting language that compiles into Lua. It gives you the power of one of the fastest scripting languages combined with a rich set of features.' Moonscript Site
* SublimeText2

and more TBD ...
